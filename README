codeswarm.rb is a rewrite of Michael Ogawa's code_swarm in ruby using cairo.

For the original code:
http://code.google.com/p/codeswarm

The format of the events xml file is compatible with code_swarm's one.

You'll need libxml-ruby and cairo ruby files. You can use gem to install the dependencies:
 sudo gem install libxml-ruby
 sudo gem install cairo

== get the events file ==

There's a tool that generates the events file from a git repository:

./util/convert-git ~/src/my-project > events.xml

Most probably you would have to edit the file to remove mistakes.

== howto generate a video ==

This describes how to generate an MPEG-4 video clip using FFmpeg, but it's also
possible to export singe png images.

First create a fifo file:
 mkfifo /tmp/codeswarm_rgb.bin

Then on a console launch ffmpeg:
 ffmpeg -f rawvideo -pix_fmt bgr32 -s 640x480 -r 60 -qscale 11 -i /tmp/codeswarm_rgb.bin /tmp/movie.avi

It will wait until there's data on the fifo file.

Then launch codeswarm.rb:
 ruby app.rb

That's it!
