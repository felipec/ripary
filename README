codeswarm.rb is a rewrite of Michael Ogawa's code_swarm in ruby using cairo.

For the original code:
http://code.google.com/p/codeswarm

The format of the events xml file is compatible with code_swarm's one.

You'll need libxml-ruby and cairo ruby files. You can use gem to install the dependencies:
 gem install libxml-ruby
 gem install cairo

== howto generate a video ==

This describes how to generate an H.264 video clip using mencoder, but it's
also possible to export singe png images.

First create a fifo file:
 mkfifo /tmp/codeswarm_rgb.bin

Then on a console launch mencoder:
 mencoder -demuxer rawvideo -rawvideo w=640:h=480:fps=72:format=bgr32 \
 -ovc x264 -x264encopts crf=10 -oac copy -o /tmp/movie.avi \
 /tmp/codeswarm_rgb.bin

It will wait until there's data on the fifo file.

Then launch codeswarm.rb:
 ruby app.rb

That's it!
